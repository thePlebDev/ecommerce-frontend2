SO WHAT EVEN IS THE REACTDOM:
- the react-dom package provides DOM-specific methods that can be used at top level of your app and as an escape hatch to
get  outside of the React model id needed
- we use the render method to render a react element into the DOM in the supplied container

CREATING THE NAVBAR:
- so basically all this is, is an unordered list in html and then we are going to css the heck out of it
